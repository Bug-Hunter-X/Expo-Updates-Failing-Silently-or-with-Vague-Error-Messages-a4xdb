This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue with Expo's update mechanism. The problem manifests as silent failures or vague error messages when attempting to update an Expo application. This can stem from various sources, including network connectivity problems, server-side errors, or corruption within the update manifest.  The `expoUpdateBug.js` file reproduces the problematic behavior, while `expoUpdateSolution.js` offers solutions and strategies for effective debugging.
