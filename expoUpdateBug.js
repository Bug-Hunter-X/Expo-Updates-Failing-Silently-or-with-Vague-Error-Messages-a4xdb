This error occurs when using the `expo-updates` package in Expo.  It happens when the update process fails to download the new code or metadata. This could be due to network issues, problems with the update server, or corrupted update manifest file. The error message isn't always descriptive, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.  Debugging may involve inspecting the Expo client logs and the server-side update process to identify the point of failure.
