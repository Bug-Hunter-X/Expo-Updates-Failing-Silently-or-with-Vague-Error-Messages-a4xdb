To solve this, start by checking your network connectivity.  Ensure the device has a stable internet connection. Then, verify your update server setup is correct and the manifest file is accessible.  Use the Expo client's debugging tools (often accessed via the Expo Go app or a development client) to inspect network requests and responses related to updates. Examine the server logs for any errors. If the issue persists, try regenerating the update manifest. Consider adding more robust error handling to your application to provide informative error messages to users if an update fails. You can also use libraries like axios or fetch to make requests to your server which have more explicit error handling. For a comprehensive solution, refer to the official Expo documentation on update mechanisms and troubleshooting.
